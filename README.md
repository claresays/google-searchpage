Google Homepage project from The Odin Project is an HTML and CSS project.

The goal is to use HTML and CSS to recreate the Google Homepage, with the div sections of the Google logo in the center, the search bar text area, submit buttons, as well as the nav bar and the footer. By the end of the project, I should be able to comfortably perform these tasks:

Two ways to move a div around on the page Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page [for the nav bar] Identify the background color of an existing webpage Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage Center an element horizontally [logo and searchbar] Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page [separate file or within header] Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
